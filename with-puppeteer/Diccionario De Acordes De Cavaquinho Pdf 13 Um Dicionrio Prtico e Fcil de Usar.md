If you want to learn how to play the cavaquinho, you will need more than just a PDF dictionary of chords. You will also need a good cavaquinho teacher, a quality instrument, and a lot of practice. Here are some tips on how to find these resources and make the most of them.
 
A good cavaquinho teacher can guide you through the basics of the instrument, such as tuning, holding, strumming, and picking. They can also teach you the theory and techniques behind the chords, scales, rhythms, and melodies that are common in cavaquinho music. A good cavaquinho teacher can also help you develop your musical ear, your sense of timing, and your improvisation skills.
 
You can find a cavaquinho teacher online or in your local area. Online teachers can offer lessons via video calls, email, or chat. They can also provide you with feedback, exercises, and materials to study at your own pace. Local teachers can offer lessons in person or at a music school. They can also introduce you to other cavaquinho players and musical events in your community.
 
When choosing a cavaquinho teacher, you should look for someone who has experience and credentials in teaching and playing the cavaquinho. You should also look for someone who has a compatible style, personality, and availability with you. You should ask for a trial lesson or a sample of their work before committing to a long-term contract.
 
A quality instrument is another essential resource for learning the cavaquinho. A quality instrument is one that is well-made, well-maintained, and well-suited for your level and goals. A quality instrument can produce a clear, rich, and balanced sound that will inspire you to play more and better.
 
You can buy a cavaquinho online or at a music store. Online stores can offer a wider variety and lower prices than physical stores. However, they may not allow you to try the instrument before buying it or to return it if you are not satisfied with it. Physical stores can offer a more personal and interactive service than online stores. However, they may have a limited selection and higher prices than online stores.
 
When buying a cavaquinho, you should look for one that has a solid wood body, a smooth neck, a straight fretboard, and a sturdy bridge. You should also look for one that has a comfortable size, shape, and weight for your hands and body. You should test the instrument by playing it acoustically and electrically (if applicable) and by checking its tuning, intonation, action, and sound quality.
