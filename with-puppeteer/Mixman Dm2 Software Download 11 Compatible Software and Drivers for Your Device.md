## How to Download and Install Mixman Dm2 Software on Windows 10
 
Fortunately, there is a way to use your Mixman Dm2 on Windows 10, thanks to the work of arseneyr. He created a Windows 10 MIDI driver for the Mixman Dm2 USB turntable, which allows you to use it as a MIDI controller for any software that supports MIDI input. Here are the steps to download and install the driver:
 
1. Go to [https://github.com/arseneyr/mixman-dm2](https://github.com/arseneyr/mixman-dm2) and click on the green "Code" button. Then, click on "Download ZIP" to download the driver files.
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.
3. Before installing the driver, you need to disable Secure Boot on your computer. Secure Boot is a feature that prevents unauthorized software from running on your system. To disable Secure Boot, follow these steps:
    - Restart your computer and enter the BIOS settings. The exact method may vary depending on your computer model, but usually you need to press a key such as F2, F10, F12, or Delete during startup.
    - Once in the BIOS settings, look for an option called "Secure Boot" or something similar. It may be under a tab called "Security", "Boot", or "Advanced".
    - Disable Secure Boot by changing its value from "Enabled" to "Disabled". Save your changes and exit the BIOS settings.
4. If you have BitLocker enabled on your computer, you may want to suspend it first to avoid any issues. BitLocker is a feature that encrypts your hard drive to protect your data. To suspend BitLocker, follow these steps:
    - Go to Settings > Update & Security > Device encryption.
    - Click on "Turn off" under BitLocker status.
    - Enter your BitLocker recovery key when prompted. You can find your recovery key in your Microsoft account or in a printout or USB drive that you created when you enabled BitLocker.
5. Now you are ready to install the driver. Go to the folder where you extracted the ZIP file and double-click on "install.bat". This will run a script that will install the driver on your system.
6. You may see some warnings or prompts during the installation process. Just follow the instructions and allow the driver to be 8cf37b1e13
