To continue the article, here are some tips for playing Anno 1404:
 
- Not everything you need (or want) will be available on every island, so thereâs no point in looking for the perfect location that has everything. You will need to establish trade routes and colonize multiple islands to meet the demands of your population and unlock new buildings and technologies[^1^].
- Pay attention to the fertility of each island, as it determines what crops you can grow there. Some crops are essential for your people's needs, such as grain, hemp, and spices, while others are optional but profitable, such as indigo, silk, and dates. You can also use items or buildings that increase fertility, such as seeds or norias[^1^].
- Balance your production chains and avoid overproducing or underproducing goods. You can check the consumption and production rates of each good in the warehouse menu. You can also adjust the productivity of each building by increasing or decreasing its workforce. Try to keep a surplus of basic goods, such as food and clothing, and sell any excess goods to other players or NPCs for extra income[^1^].
- Keep an eye on your finances and avoid going into debt. You can check your income and expenses in the balance sheet menu. Your main sources of income are taxes from your citizens and trade with other players or NPCs. Your main expenses are maintenance costs for your buildings and ships, as well as salaries for your soldiers and sailors. You can also take loans from the bank or request subsidies from the emperor if you are in a pinch[^1^].
- Expand your territory and influence by building new settlements, upgrading your existing ones, and completing quests. You can also improve your reputation with other players or NPCs by trading with them, giving them gifts, or helping them in times of need. Be careful not to anger them by attacking them, spying on them, or sabotaging their buildings, as they may declare war on you or form alliances against you[^1^].

Anno 1404 is a complex and rewarding game that offers many hours of fun and challenge. If you follow these tips, you will have a smoother and more enjoyable experience. Happy building!
