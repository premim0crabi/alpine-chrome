You can also apply a tremolo, a filter, or a distortion effect to the feedback loop for more creative possibilities.
- **LuSH-101**: A multilayered polyphonic synthesizer that combines subtractive synthesis, FM synthesis, phase distortion synthesis, and more. LuSH-101 can create rich and complex sounds with up to eight layers of oscillators, filters, envelopes, LFOs, arpeggiators, and effects. You can also use the built-in mixer and morphing feature to blend and transform your sounds.
- **PunchBOX**: A bass drum synthesizer that combines synthesis and sampling to create powerful and punchy kicks. PunchBOX allows you to choose from four sound generators: a synthetic kick generator, a sample layer, a tops layer, and a click layer. You can also shape your sound with a filter, an equalizer, a bit crusher, a distortion, and a limiter.
- **Antresol**: An analog BBD stereo flanger that emulates the classic Mistress pedal from the 70s. Antresol offers a wide range of independently adjustable parameters for the left and right channels, as well as a LFO with various waveforms and synchronization options. You can also use the feedback knob to create metallic or resonant sounds.
- **Repeater**: A vintage modeled delay that offers double delay with 23 unique delay modules based on classic hardware units. Repeater can create everything from tape echoes to digital delays, with authentic modeling of saturation, noise, wow and flutter, filters, and modulation. You can also adjust the stereo image and ducking of your delays.
