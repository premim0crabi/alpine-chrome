If you want to play Command and Conquer Generals without a CD, you will need to apply a no-CD patch that modifies the game executable file to bypass the CD check. There are different versions of no-CD patches available for different game versions and languages. Here are the steps to apply a no-CD patch for Command and Conquer Generals version 1.8 in German:
 
1. Download the no-CD patch from [this website](https://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_cc_generals.shtml). You will need to select the patch that matches your game version and language. For example, if you have Command and Conquer Generals v1.8 in German, you will need to download the C&C Generals v1.8 [GERMAN] No-CD/Fixed EXE file.
2. Extract the downloaded file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a file named GENERALS.EXE.
3. Copy the GENERALS.EXE file and paste it into your game directory, where the original game executable file is located. You will need to overwrite the original file with the patched one.
4. Launch the game from the patched GENERALS.EXE file. You should be able to play Command and Conquer Generals without a CD.

Note: Applying a no-CD patch may have some risks, such as making your game incompatible with online multiplayer or official updates. Use it at your own discretion and make sure you have a backup of your original game files before applying any modifications.

Note: To play Command and Conquer Generals online using C&C Online, you will need to have the game updated to the latest version (v1.8) and have a valid CD key.
