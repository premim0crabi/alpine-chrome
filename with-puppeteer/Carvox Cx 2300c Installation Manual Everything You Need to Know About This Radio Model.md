## Step 2: Locate the Ignition Switch Harness
 
The next step is to locate the ignition switch harness in your car. This is the bundle of wires that connects to your ignition switch, which is usually located under the steering column or behind the dashboard. You will need to access this harness to connect the main unit of the Carvox Cx 2300c remote car starter. To do this, you may need to remove some panels or fasteners from your car interior. Refer to your car manual or online resources for specific instructions on how to do this for your vehicle model.
 
## Step 3: Connect the Main Unit
 
Once you have located the ignition switch harness, you will need to connect the main unit of the Carvox Cx 2300c remote car starter to it. The main unit has a wiring harness with 12 wires of different colors and functions. You will need to match each wire to its corresponding wire in the ignition switch harness. To do this, you will need to use a multimeter or a test light to identify the functions of each wire in the ignition switch harness. For example, you will need to find the wire that has power when the key is in the ON position, or the wire that controls the starter motor. Refer to the installation manual of the Carvox Cx 2300c remote car starter for more details on how to identify and connect each wire. You will also need to use a wire stripper and a crimper to splice and join each wire securely. Make sure you wrap each connection with electrical tape or use heat-shrink tubing to prevent any loose or exposed wires.
 
## Step 4: Mount the Antenna
 
The antenna is the device that receives the signals from your remote controls. You will need to mount it on your windshield near the rearview mirror. To do this, you will need to drill a small hole on your dashboard near the windshield. Then, feed the antenna wire through the hole and connect it to the main unit. Peel off the adhesive backing from the antenna and stick it on your windshield. Make sure it is facing upwards and not obstructed by any metal objects.
 
## Step 5: Mount the LED Indicator and the Valet Switch
 
The LED indicator is a small light that flashes when your alarm system is armed or triggered. The valet switch is a small button that allows you to disable or enable your alarm system manually. You will need to mount both devices on your dashboard near your steering wheel. To do this
