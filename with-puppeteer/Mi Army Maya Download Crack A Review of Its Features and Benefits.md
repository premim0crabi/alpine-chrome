## How to Use Miarmy
 
Once you have installed Miarmy, you can access it from the Maya menu bar. You will see a Miarmy menu that contains various commands and tools. The basic workflow of using Miarmy is as follows:
 
1. Create an agent: An agent is a character that has logic, animation and physical attributes. You can create an agent from scratch or use a preset agent from the library. You can also import your own rigged character and convert it to an agent using the standard bone tree builder.
2. Create a placement: A placement is a node that defines where and how many agents are generated in the scene. You can use various methods to create a placement, such as curve, mesh, locator or random.
3. Create a brain: A brain is a node that controls the logic and behavior of the agents. You can use the logic editor to create a brain or use a preset brain from the library. You can also assign different brains to different agents or groups of agents.
4. Create an action: An action is a node that defines the animation clip and transition of the agents. You can use the action editor to create an action or use a preset action from the library. You can also assign different actions to different agents or groups of agents.
5. Simulate and render: Once you have set up your agents, placements, brains and actions, you can simulate your crowd scene by clicking the play button. You can also adjust various parameters and settings to fine-tune your simulation. To render your crowd scene, you can use any renderer that supports Maya.
