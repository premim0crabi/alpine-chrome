The novel follows Thomas and his companions as they journey across France, facing dangers and enemies along the way. They encounter a mysterious hermit who claims to know the location of la Malice, a beautiful and cunning countess who tries to seduce Thomas, a fanatical monk who wants to destroy the sword, and a band of Scottish mercenaries who join forces with them. They also witness the horrors of war, such as the sack of Limoges and the massacre of its inhabitants by the Black Prince.
 
The climax of the novel is the Battle of Poitiers, where Thomas and his men fight alongside the Black Prince against the French army. The battle is described in vivid and realistic detail, showing the tactics, weapons, armour, and psychology of medieval warfare. The English use their longbows and dismounted knights to form a defensive position on a slope, while the French attack them with cavalry, crossbowmen, and infantry. The battle is a bloody and chaotic affair, with many casualties on both sides. The English manage to repel several French assaults, until a small group of English cavalry appears behind the French lines and causes a panic. The French army collapses and flees, leaving behind many prisoners, including King Jean II and his son Philip. The battle is a decisive victory for the English and a disaster for the French.
 
Thomas also manages to find la Malice during the battle, after a fierce duel with Sir Geoffrey de Charny, who had stolen it from him earlier. He discovers that the sword has a strange power that makes him fearless and ruthless in combat. He also learns that the sword is not really the sword of Saint Peter, but a pagan relic that was used by Attila the Hun and Charlemagne. He decides to keep the sword for himself, despite its dark influence.
 
The novel ends with Thomas returning to England with his men and his sword, while King Jean remains a captive of the Black Prince. Thomas is rewarded by Edward III for his service and bravery, but he also faces some troubles in his personal life. He learns that his wife has died giving birth to their son, who is named Edward after the Black Prince. He also meets his old love Genevieve, who is now married to another man. He decides to leave England and return to Gascony with his son and his sword, hoping to find peace and happiness there.
