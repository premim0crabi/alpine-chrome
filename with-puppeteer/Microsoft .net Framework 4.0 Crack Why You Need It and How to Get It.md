Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 is a software development framework that provides a consistent and comprehensive programming model for building and running applications on Windows. It includes the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which handles code execution, memory management, and other system services, and the .NET Framework Class Library, which provides a set of APIs and types for common functionality. .NET Framework 4.0 supports multiple programming languages, such as C#, F#, and Visual Basic, and allows code to be compiled into a language-agnostic Common Intermediate Language (CIL) that can run on different architectures.
