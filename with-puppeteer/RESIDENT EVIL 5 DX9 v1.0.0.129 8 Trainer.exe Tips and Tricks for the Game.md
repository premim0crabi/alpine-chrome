Are there any risks or drawbacks of using a cheat trainer for Resident Evil 5?
 
Using a cheat trainer for Resident Evil 5 may have some negative consequences, depending on how you use it. For instance, using a cheat trainer may make the game too easy or boring, and ruin the sense of challenge and accomplishment.
