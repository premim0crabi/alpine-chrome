# How to Crack DeCuius, the Software for Successions and Volture
 
DeCuius is a software developed by ACCA software, a leading company in the field of software for architecture, engineering and construction. DeCuius allows you to manage successions and volture of any type (legitimate, testamentary) and opened in any period (before or after October 3, 2006). You can import data directly from PDF or XML visure, calculate automatically shares and taxes, fill in the forms and create the required attachments, perform compliance checks and generate the XML file for electronic submission in a few clicks and with the same software[^4^].
 
DeCuius is a very useful and professional tool, but it also has a high price: 299â¬ for a single license. If you want to save money and use DeCuius for free, you might be tempted to look for a crack version on the internet. However, this is not a good idea for several reasons:
