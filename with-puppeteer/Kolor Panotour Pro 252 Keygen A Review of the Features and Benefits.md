## How to Create Virtual Tours with Kolor Panotour Pro
 
Kolor Panotour Pro is a software that allows you to create interactive virtual tours from your panoramic images. You can add hotspots, maps, videos, sounds, and other elements to make your virtual tours more engaging and immersive. You can also customize the look and feel of your virtual tours with different skins and plugins. In this article, we will show you how to create a simple virtual tour with Kolor Panotour Pro in a few steps.
 
### Step 1: Import your panoramic images
 
The first step is to import your panoramic images into Panotour Pro. You can use any type of panoramic images, such as spherical, cylindrical, or partial panoramas. You can also use gigapixel or multiresolution images for better quality and performance. To import your images, simply drag and drop them into the Panotour Pro interface or click on the Add Images button. You can also organize your images into groups if you have multiple scenes or locations in your virtual tour.
 
### Step 2: Link your panoramas with hotspots
 
The next step is to link your panoramas with hotspots. Hotspots are interactive areas that allow the user to navigate from one panorama to another or to open external content such as web pages, videos, or sounds. To add a hotspot, select a panorama in the Tour tab and click on the Edit button. Then, click on the Hotspot Editor button and choose the type of hotspot you want to add. You can adjust the position, size, rotation, and appearance of the hotspot in the editor. You can also choose the action that will be triggered when the user clicks on the hotspot, such as opening another panorama or a web page.
 
### Step 3: Add other elements to your virtual tour
 
The final step is to add other elements to your virtual tour to make it more attractive and informative. You can add maps, floor plans, thumbnails, logos, menus, buttons, and other widgets to your virtual tour using the Style tab. You can also use plugins to add more features and functionalities to your virtual tour, such as social media sharing, VR mode, gyroscope control, and more. You can find a list of available plugins on the [Kolor website](http://www.kolor.com/wiki-en/action/view/Panotour_-_Plugins).
 
## Conclusion
 
Kolor Panotour Pro is a powerful and easy-to-use software for creating virtual tours from your panoramic images. You can create stunning virtual tours with just a few clicks and customize them with various elements and plugins. However, please note that Kolor Panotour Pro has been discontinued by GoPro since 2018 and it may not be compatible with some browsers and devices in the future. If you are looking for an alternative software for creating virtual tours, you may want to check out [Pano2VR](https://ggnome.com/pano2vr), which is similar to Panotour Pro but more updated and supported.
