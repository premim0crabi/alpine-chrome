# How to Download and Use AutoIt Decompiler 3.3
 
AutoIt Decompiler 3.3 is a tool that can extract AutoIt scripts from compiled executables. It can also handle obfuscated scripts and scripts compiled with AutoHotkey. In this article, we will show you how to download and use AutoIt Decompiler 3.3 to decompile your own or other's AutoIt programs.
 
## Step 1: Download AutoIt Decompiler 3.3
 
There are several versions of AutoIt Decompiler available online, but the latest one we could find is 2.15 build (212). You can download it from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/fossabot/myAut2Exe)[^2^]. Alternatively, you can also use other decompilers such as [AutoIt-Ripper](https://github.com/mentebinaria/retoolkit/wiki/AutoIt-Decompilers)[^1^] or [Exe2Aut](https://github.com/mentebinaria/retoolkit/wiki/AutoIt-Decompilers)[^1^], depending on your preference and needs.

## Step 2: Run AutoIt Decompiler 3.3
 
After downloading and extracting the zip file, you will find a folder named !SourceCode that contains the executable file myAutToExe.exe. Double-click on it to run the program. You will see a window like this:
 ![AutoIt Decompiler 3.3 window](https://i.imgur.com/0g8Wf6y.png) 
You can drag and drop the compiled AutoIt program (PE file) into the textbox or click on the Browse button to select it manually. You can also adjust some options such as GetCamo's, Force Old Script Type, Don't delete temp files, and Verbose LogOutput. For more details on these options, please refer to the README.txt file included in the zip file.
 
## Step 3: Decompile the AutoIt program
 
Once you have selected the PE file, click on the Decompile button to start the decompilation process. The program will show you some information and progress in the log window below. If everything goes well, you will see a message saying "Done!" at the end.

The decompiled script will be saved in the same folder as the PE file, with the same name but with a .au3 extension. You can open it with any text editor or with AutoIt itself to view or edit the source code.
 
## Conclusion
 
AutoIt Decompiler 3.3 is a useful tool for anyone who wants to learn from or modify existing AutoIt programs. It can handle most versions of AutoIt and AutoHotkey, as well as some common obfuscation techniques. However, it is not a perfect tool and may not work with some programs that use advanced protection or encryption methods. In that case, you may need to use other tools or methods to decompile them.

## How to Create AutoIt Programs
 
If you want to create your own AutoIt programs, you will need to download and install AutoIt from [its official website](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/). AutoIt is a freeware scripting language that can automate tasks on Windows systems. It has a simple syntax and a rich set of functions and commands. You can also use AutoItX, a DLL/COM control that allows you to add AutoIt features to your favorite programming and scripting languages.
 
After installing AutoIt, you will find a folder named AutoIt3 that contains the program files, documentation, and examples. You can use the SciTE editor that comes with AutoIt to write and run your scripts. You can also use other editors such as Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code with AutoIt plugins or extensions.
 
To write an AutoIt script, you need to follow some basic rules:
 
- The script file must have a .au3 extension.
- The script must start with a comment line that contains the word AutoIt.
- The script can have one or more sections, such as #include, #region, #cs, #ce, etc.
- The script can have one or more functions, which are blocks of code that perform a specific task.
- The script can have one or more variables, which are containers for storing data.
- The script can have one or more statements, which are instructions that tell the script what to do.
- The script can have one or more expressions, which are combinations of values and operators that produce a result.
- The script can have one or more comments, which are lines that are ignored by the interpreter and are used for documentation purposes.

Here is an example of a simple AutoIt script that displays a message box:
 `; This is an example of an AutoIt script
; It displays a message box with some text

#include  ; This section includes a file that contains constants for the MsgBox function

; This is the main function of the script
Func Main()
    Local $sMessage = "Hello World!" ; This is a variable that stores a string value
    MsgBox($MB_OK, "Example", $sMessage) ; This is a statement that calls the MsgBox function with some parameters
EndFunc ; This marks the end of the function

Main() ; This is a statement that calls the main function` 
To run this script, you can either press F5 in SciTE or right-click on the file and select Run Script. You will see a message box like this:
 ![AutoIt message box](https://i.imgur.com/9yQ0Qn7.png) 
To compile this script into an executable file, you can either press F7 in SciTE or right-click on the file and select Compile Script. You will find the .exe file in the same folder as the .au3 file. You can run the .exe file without needing AutoIt installed on your system.
 
## What is Obfuscation?
 
Obfuscation is a technique that makes the source code of a program harder to read and understand. It can be used for various purposes, such as protecting intellectual property, preventing reverse engineering, hiding malicious code, or reducing file size. Obfuscation can be applied to any programming language, including AutoIt.
 
Some common obfuscation methods are:

- Renaming variables and functions with meaningless names or random characters.
- Removing comments and whitespace from the code.
- Replacing literals and constants with expressions or functions.
- Using encryption or compression algorithms to transform the code.
- Using control flow obfuscation techniques such as goto statements, loops, conditional statements, etc.

Here is an example of an obfuscated AutoIt script that displays a message box:
 `; 0bFusC4t3d 4uT0iT sCr1pT
; 1t d1spl4ys 4 mEss4gE b0x w1th s0mE tExt

#NoTrayIcon
#include 

Global $a = _StringEncrypt(1,"Hello World!","key",1)
Global $b = _StringEncrypt(1,"Example","key",1 8cf37b1e13
