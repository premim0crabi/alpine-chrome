## Step 2: Unpack the Archive
 
After you download iGO Primo, you will get a compressed archive file that contains all the necessary files for the software. You need to unpack this archive to the root of your SD card or resident flash memory. You can use any file manager or archiver software that supports ZIP or RAR formats.
 
Once you unpack the archive, you should see a folder named iGO or iGO8 on your SD card or resident flash memory. This folder contains the executable file (iGO 8.3.5.193799.exe), the configuration file (sys.txt), and other subfolders for data, content, license, etc.
 
## Step 3: Put Your Maps and Other Content
 
The next step is to put your maps and other content files into the appropriate subfolders of the iGO folder. You can find various maps and content files for iGO Primo on the internet, such as [this forum topic](https://gpszone.ro/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=2429), where you can download the latest maps for Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.
 
You need to copy the map files (.fbl) into the iGO/content/map folder, the point of interest files (.poi) into the iGO/content/poi folder, the speed camera files (.spc) into the iGO/content/speedcam folder, and so on. You can also add other content files such as voices, skins, buildings, etc., depending on your preferences.
 
## Step 4: Modify Your sys.txt File
 
The last step before launching iGO Primo is to modify your sys.txt file according to your device's specifications and settings. The sys.txt file is located in the iGO folder and contains various parameters that affect the performance and appearance of iGO Primo.
 
You can open and edit the sys.txt file with any text editor software that supports UTF-8 encoding. You need to make sure that the values in the sys.txt file match your device's screen resolution, memory size, GPS port and baud rate, sound volume, language, etc.
 
You can find examples of sys.txt files for different devices and resolutions on [this forum post](https://www.gpspower.net/igo-primo-software-tools/350771-igo-primo-old-gps-former-win-ce.html). You can also customize your sys.txt file by adding or changing other parameters that suit your needs.
 
## Step 5: Launch iGO Primo
 
Now you are ready to launch iGO Primo on your Windows CE 5.0 device. You just need to execute the iGO 8.3.5.193799.exe file from your SD card or resident flash memory. You should see a splash screen followed by a license agreement screen.
