Main Hoon Kharidaar is a movie that will appeal to those who enjoy watching drama, thriller and erotic genres. The movie has some scenes that may be disturbing or offensive to some viewers, so discretion is advised. The movie can be watched online on various streaming platforms or downloaded from torrent sites.
  
The movie has three main characters: Raj (Sameer Sarkit), a wealthy businessman who is bored with his marriage and seeks pleasure in other women; Priya (Reena Chudasama), a young and beautiful woman who works as a call girl to support her family; and Shalini (Sarika), a married woman who is unhappy with her husband and falls in love with Raj. The movie shows how their lives intersect and how they face the consequences of their actions.
 
The movie has some twists and turns that keep the viewers engaged and curious. The movie also has some songs and dances that add to the entertainment value. The movie has been compared to other Bollywood movies such as Murder, Jism and Aitraaz that deal with similar themes of adultery, lust and betrayal.
 
Main Hoon Kharidaar is a movie that will make you think about the moral values and the choices you make in life. The movie will also make you question the meaning of love, happiness and loyalty. The movie is a bold and daring attempt to show the reality of the society and the human nature.
  
One of the quotes from the movie that sums up the theme is: "Main hoon kharidaar, main hoon bikta maal. Main hoon har kisi ka khwaab, main hoon har kisi ka haal." (I am the buyer, I am the sold commodity. I am everyone's dream, I am everyone's condition.) This quote shows how the characters are driven by their desires and how they use and manipulate each other for their own benefits.
 
The movie can be compared to another Bollywood movie called Red Swastik that was released in the same year. Both movies have similar plots and themes of sex, crime and revenge. Both movies also have controversial scenes and dialogues that caused controversy and censorship issues. However, Red Swastik was more violent and graphic than Main Hoon Kharidaar and received more negative reviews from critics and audiences.
 
In my opinion, Main Hoon Kharidaar is a movie that has some merits and some flaws. The movie has a good concept and a realistic depiction of the society and the human nature. The movie also has some good performances by the actors, especially Reena Chudasama who played the role of Priya with conviction and emotion. However, the movie also has some drawbacks such as a weak script, poor direction and editing, and some unnecessary songs and dances that disrupt the flow of the story. The movie could have been better if it had more focus and clarity on the message and the characters.
