# What are the NATO Rules of Engagement and how are they applied?
 
The NATO Rules of Engagement (ROE) are directives that define the circumstances, conditions, degree, and manner in which force, or actions which might be construed as provocative, may be applied by NATO or NATO-led forces during military operations. They are based on international law, national law, and political guidance from the North Atlantic Council/Defence Planning Committee (NAC/DPC).

The ROE are not used to assign tasks or give tactical instructions. They are intended to provide the legal and political framework for the use of force by NATO/NATO-led forces, while preserving the inherent right of self-defence. The ROE also aim to prevent escalation of violence and to minimise collateral damage and civilian casualties.
 
The current version of the NATO ROE is MC 362/1, which was endorsed by the Military Committee on 27 June 2003 and approved by the NAC/DPC on 2 October 2003. It superseded MC 362 (FINAL), which was issued on 11 January 2000. MC 362/1 is a classified document that is releasable to Partner nations, the European Union, SFOR/KFOR, the International Security Assistance Force for Afghanistan (ISAF) and Australia.
 
The NATO ROE consist of two parts: Part I provides general guidance and principles for the formulation and implementation of ROE; Part II contains specific ROE that can be applied to different types of military operations and situations. The ROE are divided into categories according to their level of authority and applicability: Standing ROE (SROE) are applicable at all times to all NATO/NATO-led forces; Supplemental ROE (SUROE) are additional ROE that may be authorised by the NAC/DPC for specific operations or contingencies; Special ROE (SPROE) are exceptional ROE that may be authorised by the NAC/DPC for extraordinary circumstances.
 
The NATO ROE are implemented through a process of request, approval, dissemination, and review. The request for ROE is initiated by the NATO Commander who is responsible for conducting a military operation. The request is submitted to the appropriate NATO authority (usually the Strategic Commander) who reviews it and forwards it to the International Military Staff (IMS) for coordination. The IMS then submits the request to the Military Committee (MC) for endorsement. The MC then forwards the request to the NAC/DPC for approval. Once approved, the ROE are disseminated to the NATO Commander and his subordinate commanders who are responsible for ensuring that their forces comply with them. The ROE are reviewed periodically by the NATO Commander and the IMS to ensure that they remain relevant and effective.
