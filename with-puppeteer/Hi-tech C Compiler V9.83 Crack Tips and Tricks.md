HI-TECH C Compiler for PIC10/12/16 MCUs is a powerful and versatile tool for developing applications on Microchip PIC microcontrollers. It fully implements the optimizations of Omniscient Code Generationâ¢, a whole-program compilation technology that provides denser code and better performance. It also integrates into Microchip's MPLAB IDE and is compatible with all Microchip debuggers and emulators.

In this article, we will show you how to use HI-TECH C Compiler for PIC10/12/16 MCUs Version 9.83 to create, compile and debug a simple LED blinking program for a PIC16F877A microcontroller.
 
## Step 1: Install the Compiler
 
You can download the compiler from [here](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/readme_PICC_983.pdf). Follow the instructions in the release notes to install the compiler on your computer. You will need a license key to activate the compiler. You can request a free 45-day trial license from [here](http://www.htsoft.com/trial/).
 
## Step 2: Create a New Project in MPLAB IDE
 
Launch MPLAB IDE and select Project > New Project from the menu. Choose Microchip Embedded > Standalone Project as the project type and click Next. Select PIC16F877A as the device and click Next. Select HI-TECH Universal Toolsuite as the tool suite and click Next. Choose a name and location for your project and click Next. Click Finish to create the project.
 
## Step 3: Add a Source File to the Project
 
Right-click on Source Files in the project window and select New > C Source File. Name the file main.c and click Finish. A new source file will be added to your project. Double-click on main.c to open it in the editor window. Type or copy-paste the following code:
  ``` #include <htc.h>

#define _XTAL_FREQ 4000000 //4 MHz crystal

void main(void)

    TRISB = 0x00; //Set PORTB as output
    while(1)
    
        RB0 = 1; //Turn on LED connected to RB0
        __delay_ms(500); //Wait for 500 ms
        RB0 = 0; //Turn off LED
        __delay_ms(500); //Wait for 500 ms

```
<p>This code configures PORTB as output and toggles RB0 pin every 500 ms, creating a blinking effect on an LED connected to that pin.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Build and Debug the Project</h2>
<p>To build the project, select Project > Build All from the menu or press F10. The compiler will generate an object file and a hex file for your program. To debug the project, you will need a hardware debugger or emulator connected to your PIC microcontroller. You can use Microchip's PICkitâ¢, ICD or REAL ICEâ¢ devices for this purpose. Select Debugger > Select Tool from the menu and choose your device. Then select Debugger > Connect from the menu to establish communication with your device.</p>
